# Machine Learning Models for Classification
Group 6 Project for DSCI 445, Colorado Staute University

## Bank Marketing Data

- Classification problem
- 16 variables, 40k+ observations
- *Target:* Has the client subscribed a term deposit?

Our motivation was to enhance the efficiency of bank telemarketing campaigns by predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit product. Using a Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset comprising 45,211 records, the study examines 16 demographic and financial variables to address the significant class imbalance where only 11.7% of clients originally subscribed. The primary motivation is to provide a data-driven framework that allows financial institutions to target high-potential clients more effectively, thereby reducing the time and costs associated with broad, indiscriminate marketing efforts. 

Our report includes data cleaning, model formulation, feature selection, model tuning, and finally model comparison and assesment. 

The methodology centers on a comparative evaluation of multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression with Ridge and LASSO regularization, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting. Through 5-fold cross-validation and rigorous testing on a held-out test set, the study explores the critical trade-offs between model interpretability and predictive power.
